    <h2>Scope and topics</h2>
    <p>
        This one-day workshop focuses on the theoretical aspects of quantum cryptography. Due to active research and rapid progress in quantum computing, there has been significant interest in both cryptography secure against quantum computers (post-quantum cryptography) and cryptography that exploits the power of quantum information (quantum cryptography). This workshop aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas for quantum cryptography, discuss and share latest progress in this area, and to encourage and attract researchers to work in quantum cryptography.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop consists of contributed talks and a few tutorial/invited talks. This workshop solicits submissions of extended abstracts about research results on quantum cryptography. Submissions are reviewed by program committee members, who select a small number of contributed talks.
    </p>

    <h2>Proceedings</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop has no published proceedings, so it accepts submissions about recent results that have already appeared or will appear in other conferences or workshops. 
    </p>
    <p>
         The scope is all aspects of theoretical quantum cryptography including:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Theoretical foundations of quantum cryptography</li>
           <li>New cryptographic functionalities that exploit quantum information to go beyond the realm of classical possibility</li>
           <li>New tools for security proofs against quantum adversaries</li>
           <li>(Im)possibility of quantum cryptographic primitives</li>
           <li>Simpler proofs of known results,</li>
       </ul>
    <p>
        but not limited to them. Research on post-quantum cryptography is also within the scope if the techniques use concepts from quantum information.
        This workshop features theoretical talks (experimental results are **not** within the scope).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Important dates:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Talk submission deadline: August 31</li>
        <li>Talk acceptance Notification: October 7</li>
        <li>Workshop date: December 4 (Sun)</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2>Submission instructions:</h2>
    <p>
        Submissions must be written in English and at most 3 pages excluding references in A4 or letter size, using reasonable margins and at least 11pt font. Submissions must begin with a title and be anonymized (with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or any identifying citations). Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF format. An extended abstract for a talk should give a succinct and clear description of the main contributions, ideas for them, and their impact on quantum cryptography. Authors of accepted contributed talks are required to attend the workshop but can present their work remotely.
    </p>
